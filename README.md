# OverTheWire: Bandit Write-Ups
OverTheWire's first wargame titled 'Bandit' is aimed at absolute beginners. It will teach you the basics you will need to know in order to engage with their other wargames which increase in difficulty as you move up the levels. Bandit will teach you about using a Linux shell, remote connections, and SSH (secure shell).
